spec:
1. See who won each game - automatic counter
2. See running table of winners by year eg Mick (of course) has won 9/10 games in 2021 
3. See average score per player by year 
4. Notes to record things like exceptionally high game or single word scores or using all letters in a single go. Can be a text box

when submitting a score at the end of a match, add who won to the match record automatically to save headaches

need to make a page for adding scores to the system
	simplify by just having 4(5?) text fields instead of button to add/remove players?
	maybe another page to actually enter each person's score? simpler maybe?
	give a running total?
	comments box for each person for showing good stuff
	when game is finished, calculate winner, make a results screen
	maybe a graph of score against time? could be fun to see
